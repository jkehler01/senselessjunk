                                My wife and I operate our own business. We have no employees. We do not have traditional heathcare. We pay out of pocket for all our medical bills and have one very high-deductible catastrophic policy to fall back on in case we are diagnosed with certain major illnesses. Our vehicles are all paid for and our mortgage is well below the national average. Our only major expense in addition to our mortgage is the cost of tuition for our son to attend college. According to online estimators we will have to pay almost 10% of our gross income starting in 2014 for an Obamacare plan. This is not fair. We will be forced to pay almost 250% of what we are currently paying for health insurance. As a hard working, healthy American I find this unacceptable.My wife and I operate our own business.

                                <br> are all paid for and our mortgage is well below the national average. Our only major expense in addition to our mortgage is the cost of tuition for our son to attend college. According to online estimators we will have to pay almost 10% of our gross income starting in 2014 for an Obamacare plan. This is not fair. We will be forced to pay almost 250% of what we are currently paying for health insurance. As a hard working, healthy American I find this unacceptable.
